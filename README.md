# My Portfolio
This is my project portfolio, where I share a collection of work that I have developed or copied for educational and learning purposes. Each project has its own directory with a brief description.

## Projects
Here is a list of the top projects in this repository:

1. **[Quiz](https://berghzg.github.io/My-Portfolio/Quiz/)**  
   This is an interactive quiz project about the science fiction series *Doctor Who*, created by the BBC. The quiz consists of 10 multiple-choice questions about the characters, episodes, and interesting facts from the series. The aim is to test your knowledge and passion for the Doctor Who universe.

2. **[Discord Bot](https://github.com/BerghzG/My-Portfolio/tree/main/Bot%20de%20Discord)**  
   This is a Discord bot made with Python that plays a points game. The player adds points by summoning the bot using the "!pontos" command.

3. **[Login with PySimpleGUI](https://github.com/BerghzG/My-Portfolio/tree/main/PySimpleGui%20Login)**  
   This is a simple user login and registration system developed in Python with the PySimpleGUI library. The system allows users to log in with a previously registered username and password, in addition to offering the option to save the login, register new users, and view the list of registered users.

4. **[My Bot Portfolio](https://t.me/BerghzBot)**  
   This is my Telegram bot (in pt-br), a low-code bot created to present my portfolio and provide project options. With this bot, you can explore my professional portfolio and request a quote for a specific project. It was developed to make it easier to view my projects and offer an interactive way to interact with my portfolio.

5. **[Jokenpo](https://berghzg.github.io/My-Portfolio/Jokenpo/)**  
   In this game, players can compete against the computer in a classic game of rock, paper, scissors. The game includes an attractive and interactive design, a scoreboard to keep track of scores, and the ability to reset the score with just one click.

6. **[Ping Pong Game](https://github.com/BerghzG/My-Portfolio/tree/main/PyGame%20Project)**  
   This is a ping pong game developed in Python with the Pygame library, inspired by the classic Atari game. The goal is to provide a fun and nostalgic experience for players, recreating the atmosphere of retro games.

7. **[Portfolio Website](https://berghzg.github.io/My-Portfolio/Bootstap%20Portifolio/)**  
   This site provides an overview of who I am and what I can offer. It was created using HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and modern design.

8. **[Web Blog](https://blog-w1k7.onrender.com/)**  
   This is a personal blog, developed with Node.js, Express, EJS, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript. Users can create, edit, and delete posts. The blog works offline, storing information locally. However, if the user switches to incognito mode, posts created during that session will be lost when the application is closed.

9. **[AnimeFinder](https://animefinder-9dp1.onrender.com)**  
   AnimeFinder is an application that allows users to search for animes by text or image. It provides detailed information such as synopses, trailers, characters, and voice actors. The app also allows users to create personal lists (watched, watching, dropped, and favorites) stored in JSON files. It displays updated anime news every 24 hours through The News API.
